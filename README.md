# Capstone Travel App

## Summary

I created an application that makes API calls to Geonames, Weatherbit, and Pixabay combined with user input to show a trip summary with destination name, weather forecast, and photo.

## Methods

I started with the previous project as a base for this, as it had working versions of webpack and the various plugins I needed.

## Stand Out Section

In the event that Pixabay doesn't have a photo match for the destination specified, it will show a photo of the country of the destination specified.
