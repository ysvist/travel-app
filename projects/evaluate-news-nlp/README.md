# Sentiment Analysis Assignment

## Summary

I created an application that makes an API call to MeaningCloud with a user input URL to get a sentiment analysis of the URL and display it.

## Issues I Ran Into

A lot of the problems I ran into with webpack and plugins and loaders not working together weren't really explained in the course materials. I couldn't even follow along with the course lessons because all of the versions were different and no longer worked together nicely. It was an infuriating mix of trying a lot of things and trying to understand why they failed, as well as hunting through the project forums for where instructors provided correctly functioning versions. Realistic for how it is in the real world, but not a positive learning experience.

## Why Did You Use Comic Sans?

To test my ability.

### Credits

- Copied **package-lock versions** from udacity forum answers and from a working version by @ElineJ at github to make things actually work together nicely
- Also referenced @ElineJ's code for the JSDOM testing method
